backbone-require-seed
=====================

Starting point to create modular and AMD apps with Backbone, Require, jQuery, Jasmine,
and HTML boilerplate (from [http://html5boilerplate.com](http://html5boilerplate.com)) with CSS normalisation.

You can use the file boilerplate.js as a template to create new elements in your app (such as models, collections or views).

Fully based on something from GitHub — please check the history to see the fork.

I'm not sure I'm keen on the app dir layout: sometimes laying out by component type makes
less sense than laying out functional type.
